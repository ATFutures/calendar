<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r setup, include = FALSE}

# ical

The goal of ical is to work with .ics file in R.



Recently the UK Government endorsed the iCal format in a [publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/exchange-of-calendar-events) Open Standards for Government' series.
[An example .ics file](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays/england-and-wales.ics) is provided by the .gov.uk domain, which shows holidays in England and Wales.

<!-- ## Installation -->

<!-- You can install the released version of ical from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("ical") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
