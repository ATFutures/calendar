DESCRIPTION:Dear all\n\nThere is a call out for EPSRC networks on Decarboni
 sing Transport https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/calls/decarbonising-transpor
 t-networks/\n\nI am organising a workshop across the N8 on Thursday 6th Se
 ptember to build a consortium for the network. Whilst there will be very l
 imited spaces at the workshop I want to encourage as broad a representatio
 n from ITS in the final network themes and approach. I would therefore inv
 ite any interested people to come along with ideas related to the call on 
 Weds 5th at noon. For those that have expressed an interest in workshop at
 tendance this will be confirmed either way by Wednesday of this week.\n\nB
 est regards\n\nGreg\n\n

 o: All TRA Staff <Staff.TRA@ds.leeds.ac.uk<mailto:Staff.TRA@ds.leeds.ac.uk
 >>\nCc: Andrew Dougill <A.J.Dougill@leeds.ac.uk<mailto:A.J.Dougill@leeds.a
 c.uk>>\nSubject: Faculty Structures: Discussion Meetings\n\nDear All\,\n\n
 As we move into a new academic year\, I am writing to reflect on some of t
 he notable successes of the last year and to guide on key discussions for 
 the Faculty in moving forward to address forthcoming challenges and opport
 unities.\n\nLooking back\, I would like to thank you all for the hard work
  across the last academic year that led to successful graduation for the "
 Class of 2018" and helped each School to both consolidate their position h
 igh in global subject standings. Notably\, we saw £46M of new research aw
 ards across the Faculty last year which will provide exciting opportunitie
 s to extend our impact and profile in years to come. Importantly\, each Sc
 hool ended the financial year with a small surplus despite the significant
  challenges faced due to below plan student recruitment last year.\n\nAs w
 e approach the 2018/19 academic year\, undergraduate student recruitment l
 ooks like being close to our planned level for home / EU students (though 
 with some Programmes showing low numbers).  However\, international studen
 t recruitment is likely to fall short of planned levels at both UG & PGT l
 evels (final efforts through September can hopefully help here!). This con
 tinues the need for us to enhance our efforts facing international partner
 ships as vital steps to ensure financial sustainability through times of u
 ncertainty across the HE sector (e.g. due to changing UK demographics\, Br
 exit and UKRI changes).\n\nForward planning for the Faculty of Environment
  will link to University level discussions on the future alignment of Facu
 lty structures as per the VC’s note - https://www.leeds.ac.uk/forstaff/n
 ews/article/6229/realignment_of_faculties_to_be_c  .\nTo inform such discu
 ssions and to feed into a University Senate paper on this\, I will be hold
 ing three open discussion meetings on Faculty structures in the coming wee
 ks as below:-\n\n-       Thursday 6th September\, 2 p.m. (SEE\, 8.119)\n- 
       Monday 10th September\, 2 p.m  (SoG\, 8.11)\n-       Wednesday 12th 
 September\, 2 p.m. (ITS\, 1.11)\n\nPlease attend any of these (ie. not jus
 t the one hosted in your home School!) for a two-way discussion on the pos
 sible options for our future positioning within the University’s Faculty
  governance. Discussion will include consideration of the ways we can best
  encourage interdisciplinary working across Schools and Faculties to build
  on existing synergies and maximise new opportunities as part of the Unive
 rsity vision and strategy beyond 2020.\n\nThanks\,\n\nAndy Dougill\n\nDean
  of Faculty of Environment\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom: Richard Batley\nSent: 20 Augus

DESCRIPTION:SIP-adus Human Factors & HMI Research for Automated Driving Exp
 eriments on External HMI\n\n\nPresented by Prof Tatsuru Daimon<https://www
 .st.keio.ac.jp/en/tprofile/ae/daimon.html>\, Keio University\, Japan.\n\nA
 bstract\nHuman drivers are conducting various communication with periphera
 l traffic participants such as pedestrians and other drivers in order to i
 mprove safety and traffic efficiency. For example\, they use eye-contact\,
  hand-gesture\, etc. However\, how do automated vehicles communicate with 
 peripheral traffic participants? In this presentation\, we introduce human
  factors and HMI research for automated driving experiments on external HM
 I.\n\nBio\nTatsuru Daimon is a professor at Faculty of Science and Technol
 ogy\, Keio University in Japan. He received Ph.D. degree from Keio Univers
 ity in 1995. He conducted researches on human factors of car navigations a
 nd firings of primary neurons of cutaneous sensation as a COE (Center of E
 xcellence) visiting researcher\, National Institute of Bioscience and Huma
 n-Technology\, MITI\, Japan\, and visual contents of route guidance system
  as a foreign researcher of French National Institute for Transport and Sa
 fety Research in 1995 and 1996 respectively. Since then\, he has researche
 d human factors and human machine interfaces (HMI) of Intelligent Transpor
 t Systems (ITS) such as advanced HUD and in-vehicle/roadside cooperative i
 nformation systems\, based on a simulator and a field experiments in Keio 
 University. In recent years\, he has been also researching human factors a
 nd HMI of automated driving systems\, which includes external HMI for comm
 unication between automated vehicle and surrounding road users.\n\nFurther

DESCRIPTION:Invitation to RAMETS event for PGRs and Staff at LUBS and ITS\n
 \n•       Wednesday 19th September 2018\, 1-5pm\, Rm 1.11 ITS\, lunch pr
 ovided\n•       LUBS Economics and ITS speakers (20 mins presentations\,
  10 mins Q&A)\n\nResearch Applications and Methods for Economics and Trans
 port Studies (RAMETS) is a collaborative event bringing together PGRs from
  the Business School Economics Division and Institute for Transport Studie
 s (ITS) to discuss methods and applications used during the PhD process. E
 conomics and ITS share many common methods and issues that are closely rel
 ated from different perspectives and this is an opportunity for PGRs to co
 me together and learn from each other. Recognising the increasing need for
  inter-disciplinary research\, this event aims to establish a platform for
  students and staff alike to find like-minded and potential collaborators\
 , share experiences and gain alternative approaches to investigate their r
 esearch topics. RAMETS focuses on quantitative and qualitative methods and
  applications such as interviews\, surveys\, dynamic modelling and econome
 tric techniques. Presentations will be given by PGRs and will be focussed 
 on either a method or an application of a specific method in order to prov
 ide insight. The purpose is to learn from each other and to share our expe
 riences.\n\nIf you are interested in giving a presentation or bringing a p
 oster to the event please contact Tahera Mayat (bn14t2m@leeds.ac.uk<mailto

DESCRIPTION:\nPlanning for sustainable and resilient cities:\nImproving dec
 ision-making through accessibility instruments\n\n\nPresented by Dr Benjam
 in B<http://www.sv.bgu.tum.de/en/team/dr-ing-benjamin-buettner/>[X]ttner\,
  Technical University of Munich\, Germany.\n\nDate: Tuesday 9th October 20
 18\nTime: 13.30-14.30\nLocation: rm 1.11 Institute for Transport Studies<h
 ttp://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/map/>\n\nAbstract\nAccessibility is an important
  concept in regards to the integration of land-use and transport planning.
  Planning for sustainable and resilient cities requires the consideration 
 and implementation of accessibility principles. When planning for accessib
 ility\, it is important to take into account the necessities of multiple s
 cales of the urban environment as well as the citizens’ needs. This make
 s it possible to create urban spaces that are livable for everyone.\nThe d
 ecision-making process needs to be based on sound\, scientific evaluation 
 of measures and strategies. Politicians and citizens alike need appropriat
 e tools in order to make informed decisions. Decision-making tools should 
 help stakeholders understand the effects and magnitude of planned land-use
  and transportation measures. The potential effects of such measures\, suc
 h as gentrification\, can significantly impact the lives and wellbeing of 
 citizens and it is essential that the decision-making process takes this i
 nto account. How can accessibility instruments foster a sound decision-mak
 ing process with multiple and diverse stakeholder groups?\n\nBio\nBenjamin
  Büttner has worked at the Chair of Urban Structure and Transport Plannin
 g since July 2010. He is a graduated PhD in engineering after having a Ger
 man Diploma in geography and works currently at the Chair in the fields of
  accessibility planning\, Governance\, Urban Structure and Neighborhood Mo
 bility. The focus of his professional skills are urban and transport plann
 ing\, geo-information systems\, empirical research and survey methods.\n\n
 All welcome. No booking required.\n\nFor further information about the ITS
