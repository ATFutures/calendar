ical
====

The goal of ical is to work with iCalander (`.ics`) files in R. iCalendar is an open standard for "exchanging calendar and scheduling information between users and computers" described at [icalendar.org](https://icalendar.org/)

Recently the UK Government endorsed the iCal format in a [publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/exchange-of-calendar-events) Open Standards for Government' series. [An example .ics file](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays/england-and-wales.ics) is provided by the .gov.uk domain, which shows holidays in England and Wales.

Installation

<!-- ``` -->
Example
-------

``` r
ics_file <- system.file("extdata", "england-and-wales.ics", package = "ical")
readLines(ics_file, n = 9) # check it's in the ICS format
#> [1] "BEGIN:VCALENDAR"                     
#> [2] "VERSION:2.0"                         
#> [3] "METHOD:PUBLISH"

#> [8] "DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20120102"         
#> [9] "SUMMARY:New Yearâ€™s Day"
ics_df = ic_read(ics_file) # read it in
head(ics_df) # check the results
#>            dtstamp
#> 1 20180806T114130Z
#> 2 20180806T114130Z
