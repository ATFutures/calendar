ical
====

The goal of ical is to work with .ics file in R.

Recently the UK Government endorsed the iCal format in a [publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/exchange-of-calendar-events) Open Standards for Government' series. [An example .ics file](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays/england-and-wales.ics) is provided by the .gov.uk domain, which shows holidays in England and Wales.

<!-- ## Installation -->
<!-- You can install the released version of ical from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("ical") -->
<!-- ``` -->
Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
